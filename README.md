# AI-Powered Puzzle Solver Project
   Me and My team developed an innovative AI-powered program designed to solve complex puzzles efficiently. Utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, our system analyzes the puzzle's structure and generates optimal solutions. The project involved creating a versatile solver capable of handling various types of puzzles, including jigsaw puzzles, Sudoku, and logic-based puzzles. Through rigorous testing and refinement, our program demonstrated remarkable accuracy and speed, providing solutions in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods. This project showcases the potential of AI in enhancing problem-solving capabilities and offers valuable applications in education, gaming, and cognitive training.-2nd year
